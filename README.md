## `Travel form`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro
This project was created as a practice for an Introdutory course in React.js from the FreeCodeCamp Web Course.

This project allowed the practice of the Forms Elements as controlled components by React.

## Objective
The objective of the page is to create a Form to a passenger in an airline, where the passenger will add as Inputs: First Name, Last Name, Age, Gender and Dietary Restrictions. Also, the person will need to select a destination and submit the form with a Button Submit.

After the submission of the form, the information entered on the form should be displayed on the screen as an Alert. 

As an extra, the passenger can also see the entered inputs below the form prior the submission of the form (that can be used to check which information JavaScript Functions have access with the handleChange Function).
